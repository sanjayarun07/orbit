# Production release gates

## Configuration and durable state

Use PostgreSQL and Redis with `ALLOW_MEMORY_FALLBACK=false`. Memory mode is
development-only: restart recovery cannot be guaranteed without PostgreSQL.
Keep `LIVE_TRADING=false` until wallet, RPC, persistence and provider integration
tests have passed in the target deployment. Keep `EXPOSE_TOOL_TRAJECTORY=false`.
Back up trade_plans and relay_executions; do not purge unsettled records.

Jupiter signatures are now stored atomically with the submission claim before
broadcast. RPC acceptance means submitted, not executed. The worker polls chain
history and requires finalized evidence for executed/failed. Missing signatures
remain submission_unknown; never automatically rebroadcast or create a retry.
Old submitting records without signatures require manual explorer/provider
investigation. They cannot be safely reconstructed by guessing.

Relay execution claims persist the provider request ID before wallet approval.
The SDK signs with the wallet; the backend independently checks Relay's status
API. Deposits and pending fills are not success; refunds are not successful swaps.
Provider status documentation: https://docs.relay.link/references/api/get-intents-status-v3
An abandoned wallet approval remains unknown; get a fresh reviewed quote only
after checking the old request and wallet activity.
Context replacement is checked before entering the wallet SDK, but Orbit cannot
revoke a transaction already approved/broadcast by an external wallet. Cancelling
a chat request is not an on-chain transaction cancellation.

Both reconcilers restart with the app, never sign and never rebroadcast. Monitor
the age/count of unresolved records, database availability and provider errors.
Multiple workers are safe for terminal updates, but duplicate read polling costs
more; assign reconciliation to one worker deployment at larger scale.

## Credential rotation (provider administrator required)

1. Inventory configured secret variable names without displaying their values.
2. Create replacement credentials in each provider dashboard, with minimum scope
   and production restrictions. Prioritize every key ever pasted, logged or committed.
3. Update the deployment secret manager and local .env; do not paste keys into chat.
4. Restart services and verify a low-cost read-only request per provider.
5. Revoke the old keys and verify they no longer authorize requests.
6. Record provider, key identifier, operator and rotation time—not the secret.

`scripts/check_secrets.py` checks the staged baseline and recognizes common key
formats. Locally it also checks for literal .env secret values. It cannot revoke
keys or prove that a key was not leaked elsewhere.

## Repository protections (repository administrator required)

After setting a remote and commit author, commit the audited baseline on the
codex/production-consolidation branch. Open a PR; never force-push a baseline over
an existing repository. Protect the release branch with:

- Pull requests and at least one independent approving review.
- Required `test` CI check, up-to-date branches, resolved review conversations.
- No force pushes or branch deletion; restrict bypass permissions.
- Secret scanning and push protection where supported by the hosting plan.

No remote or author was configured in this checkout when this pass began.
Local CI files do not activate host-level protections automatically.
